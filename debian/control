Description: Library of Optimized Inner Loops Runtime Compiler
 Orc is a library and set of tools for compiling and executing
 very simple programs that operate on arrays of data.  The "language"
 is a generic assembly language that represents many of the features
 available in SIMD architectures, including saturated addition and
 subtraction, and many arithmetic operations.
 .
 This package contains the orc shared libraries.  It is typically
 installed automatically when an application or library requires it.
